stk.fm was an extension of stkbuzz. I had the idea that it would be funny to do dramatic readings of certain posts on the site (I ended up getting people from Fiverr to do them and they turned out great) but I had no good medium to share them with the users of stkbuzz. After considering my options, I decided that the best way was a streaming online radio station. 

As I had to shut down stkbuzz, stk.fm is no longer up and running either. However, I do plan to open source parts of the project in the near future as to not let it all go to waste.

Building stk.fm was quite a project. It involved a lot of screwing around with Icecast, MPD, and Python. I learned a lot in the process and actually wrote a series of three detailed blog posts about it for Dead Coder Society; check them out here: [part 1](http://www.deadcodersociety.org/building-a-streaming-radio-station-part-1-icecast-mpd-and-python/), [part 2](http://www.deadcodersociety.org/building-a-streaming-radio-station-part-2-iframe-hacks-and-jplayer/), [part 3](http://www.deadcodersociety.org/building-a-streaming-radio-station-part-3-streaming-analytics/)
