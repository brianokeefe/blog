Sheet is a responsive theme for the [Ghost](https://ghost.org) blogging platform that I designed specifically for bokstuff.com. You're looking at it right now!

It's built upon the [Pure](http://purecss.io) Grids module, which I can wholeheartedly recommend. It introduces very little cruft to your HTML and doesn't make massive assumptions about how your project should look and feel - anyone who has worked with certain other frontend frameworks can appreciate that.

Sheet is free and open source. [Check it out on Github](https://github.com/brianokeefe/sheet)!
